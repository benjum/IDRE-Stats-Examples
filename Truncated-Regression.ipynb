A study of students in a special GATE (gifted and talented education) program wishes to model achievement as a function of language skills and the type of program in which the student is currently enrolled. A major concern is that students are required to have a minimum achievement score of 40 to enter the special program. Thus, the sample is truncated at an achievement score of 40.\n",

If the researcher had a sample of Americans whose income was at or below the poverty line, then the upper part of the income distribution would be truncated. In other words, truncation is a result of sampling only part of the distribution of the outcome variable."

    "\n",
    "* OLS regression – You could analyze these data using OLS regression.  OLS regression will not adjust the estimates of the coefficients to take into account the effect of truncating the sample at 40, and the coefficients may be severely biased.  This can be conceptualized as a model specification error (Heckman, 1979).\n",
    "* Truncated regression – Truncated regression addresses the bias introduced when using OLS regression with truncated data.  Note that with truncated regression, the variance of the outcome variable is reduced compared to the distribution that is not truncated. Also, if the lower part of the distribution is truncated, then the mean of the truncated variable will be greater than the mean from the untruncated variable; if the truncation is from above, the mean of the truncated variable will be less than the untruncated variable.\n",
    "* These types of models can also be conceptualized as Heckman selection models, which are used to correct for sampling selection bias.\n",
    "* Censored regression – Sometimes the concepts of truncation and censoring are confused. With censored data we have all of the observations, but we don’t know the “true” values of some of them. With truncation, some of the observations are not included in the analysis because of the value of the outcome variable. It would be inappropriate to analyze the data in our example using a censored regression model."
